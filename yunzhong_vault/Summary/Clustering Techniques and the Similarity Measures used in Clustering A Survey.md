https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290797421_Clustering_Techniques_and_the_Similarity_Measures_used_in_Clustering_A_Survey

The paper mainly suggested the advantages and the limitations exists in clustering algorithms. Its a survey based paper, no actual solutions or algorithms are proposed. The paper introduce a little bit about clustering techniques, including partitional clustering, density clustering and hierarchical clustering. Then it point out that distance similarity measure sometimes cannot capture some similar patterns between data(e.g. shift in one dimension). Also, it also mentioned that negative data such as ionosphere is also hard to clustering, where very less research exists in this area. Its good that this paper listed lots of literatures in the clustering area and explained what basically they are doing. Also, the analysis of the existing challanges in clustering is also valuable. However, the paper only provides an naive idea to overcome this challanges. No new technique is proposed.
