[[LLM]] Large Language Models
1. The article explores whether the ability to attribute beliefs to others is innate or acquired through language exposure.
    
2. The study involves a linguistic version of the False Belief Task.
    
3. Human participants and the GPT-3 language model are tested for their sensitivity to others' beliefs.
    
4. Both humans and GPT-3 exhibit some level of sensitivity to others' beliefs.
    
5. However, GPT-3's performance in this regard is not as high as that of humans.
    
6. Despite exposure to extensive language data, GPT-3 doesn't fully explain human behavior in attributing beliefs to others.
    
7. The findings suggest that while language exposure may partially contribute to humans' ability to understand others' mental states, other mechanisms are also at play.
