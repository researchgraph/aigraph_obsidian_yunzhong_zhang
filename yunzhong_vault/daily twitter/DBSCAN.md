it does a great job of seeking areas in the data that have a high density of observations, versus areas of the data that are not very dense with observations. DBSCAN can sort data into clusters of varying shapes as well

1. DBSCAN is an unsupervised clustering method based on data similarity.
2. It separates data into high-density and low-density clusters.
3. DBSCAN handles outliers effectively.
4. The algorithm requires parameters for cluster size and distance.
5. Silhouette Score is used to evaluate DBSCAN clusters.
6. Inertia is not suitable for DBSCAN evaluation.
7. Python code is provided for DBSCAN implementation.
