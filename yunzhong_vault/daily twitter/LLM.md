1. A language model is a machine learning model designed to predict and generate natural language, such as autocomplete suggestions.
    
2. Language models estimate the probability of tokens or sequences of tokens within a longer text.
    
3. Large language models (LLMs) have evolved to predict entire sentences, paragraphs, or even entire documents.
    
4. LLMs have seen significant growth due to advancements in computer memory, dataset sizes, and processing power.
    
5. "Large" in the context of LLMs can refer to the number of model parameters or the size of the training dataset.
    
6. Transformers, introduced in 2017, are a pivotal architecture for LLMs, designed around the concept of attention, which helps process longer text sequences efficiently
