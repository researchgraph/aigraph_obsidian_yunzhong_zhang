1. **[[BERT]](Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):**
    
    - [[LLM]] Developed by Google in 2018.
    - Employs bidirectional context for natural language understanding.
    - Pre-trained on unlabeled text using masked language model pre-training.
    - Used for downstream tasks with fine-tuning or feature-based approaches.
2. **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers):**
    
    - Developed by Meta.
    - Combines bidirectional and autoregressive capabilities.
    - Consists of a bidirectional encoder and an autoregressive decoder.
    - Useful for both sequence generation and downstream tasks.
3. **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer):**
    
    - Follows the Transformer architecture.
    - Contains 220 million parameters.
    - Represents all tasks as text-to-text problems.
    - Employs a unique masking method for unsupervised pre-training.

These models have revolutionized [[NLP]] and offer diverse approaches to language understanding and generation.
